## 🎯 What is Navigator?

> **If you build Microsoft Copilot Studio agents, you know the pain:** every time you want to test a change, you're stuck manually exporting, importing, publishing — a process that eats 10-15 minutes of your day, every single time. Multiply that across a team and environments, and you're losing hours to deployment busywork instead of building. **Navigator eliminates that entirely.**

Navigator is a **Claude Code skill** — type `/navigator` in Claude Code CLI or the VS Code Claude extension and your agent is live in another environment in seconds. Under the hood it talks directly to the Dataverse API, handles every component type (topics, knowledge sources, agent skills), and shields you from all the Power Platform ceremony. No manual exports. No solution wizards. No context-switching.

- 🧭 **Claude Skill first** — invoke with `/navigator` in Claude Code CLI or VS Code, describe what you want in plain English
- 🚀 **30-60 second deploys** — Smart Test mode pushes any agent to any environment without solution packaging
- 🏗️ **Production-grade DV Solution Migration** — full solution packaging with audit trail when governance matters
- 🔒 **Production safety built-in** — auto-escalates to DV Solution Migration when targeting Production
- ⚙️ **Zero manual steps** — authenticate once with Azure CLI, then just talk to Claude
- 🆓 **Free and open-source** — no licences, no SaaS fees, no API keys required

---

Navigator gives you **two ways to move copilots between environments:**

### ⚡ Smart Test Mode
**For Testing & Iteration**
- ⏱️ **30-60 seconds** deployment time

|----------|---------|----------|
| **Claude API Key** | [Get key](https://console.anthropic.com/) | AI-powered migration analysis |

> ✅ **Navigator works perfectly without API keys!** AI features are 100% optional.

---

### Installation Options

#### Option 1: As Claude Code Skill (Recommended)

If you use Claude Code, install Navigator as a skill for easy access:

```powershell
# Run the installer
cd C:\code\ClaudeCopilotMgmtSkill
.\install-skill.ps1
```

Then use it in Claude Code:
```
/navigator quick          # Smart Test deploy
/navigator dv             # DV Solution Migration
```

**Restart Claude Code** after installation.

> ⚠️ **Note:** The installer copies files to `~/.claude/skills/navigator/`. Two copies are maintained — your project folder and the installed copy. After any project update, re-run `.\install-skill.ps1 -Update` to keep the installed copy in sync.

---

#### Option 2: Standalone PowerShell

No installation needed! Just run the scripts directly:

```powershell
cd C:\code\ClaudeCopilotMgmtSkill
.\Navigator.ps1
```

---

#### Option 3: VS Code Extension

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 18+, npm

```powershell
# 1. Build the extension
cd C:\code\ClaudeCopilotMgmtSkill\vscode-extension
npm install
npm run compile

# 2. Package it
npm install -g @vscode/vsce
vsce package

# 3. Install in VS Code
code --install-extension navigator-vscode-1.0.0.vsix
```

Or sideload during development:
1. Open `vscode-extension/` in VS Code
2. Press `F5` to launch Extension Development Host

**After installing:**
- `Ctrl+Shift+T` → Smart Test
- Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) → "Navigator: Smart Test" or "Navigator: DV Solution Migration"

---

## 🎨 Usage

Navigator has two deployment modes. You can trigger either from Claude Code, PowerShell, or VS Code.

---

### 🧭 How to Invoke Navigator

#### ⭐ Claude Code Skill — Recommended

> The primary way to use Navigator. Type a natural language command and Claude handles the rest — no parameters to remember, no terminal to switch to.

**In Claude Code CLI or the VS Code Claude extension:**

```
/navigator Sales Assistant to UAT
```

```
/navigator dv Sales Assistant to Production
```

Navigator responds inline:

```
⚡ Smart Test → UAT...
[1/3] ✅ Retrieved 15 components
[2/3] ✅ Updated copilot
[3/3] ✅ Published

✅ Done in 35 seconds!
🔗 Test URL: https://copilotstudio.microsoft.com/...
```

- Natural language — describe what you want
- No parameters to remember
- Progress shown in the conversation
- Works in Claude Code CLI and VS Code Claude extension

---

#### 2️⃣ VS Code Extension

Never leave your IDE. Use the keyboard shortcut or Command Palette:

```
Ctrl+Shift+T                          → Smart Test
Ctrl+Shift+P → Navigator: Smart Test  → Smart Test
Ctrl+Shift+P → Navigator: DV Solution Migration → DV mode
```

1. Enter bot name in the input box
2. Select target environment from the dropdown
3. Watch progress notifications: `[1/3]`, `[2/3]`, `[3/3]`
4. Click **"Open Test Chat"** on completion (Smart Test)

Full output is captured in the **Navigator output channel**.

---

#### 3️⃣ PowerShell Script

For automation, CI/CD pipelines, or when running without Claude Code:

```powershell
.\Navigator.ps1 -Mode SmartTest -BotName "Sales Assistant" -Target "UAT"
.\Navigator.ps1 -Mode DV -BotName "Sales Assistant" -Target "Production"
```

- Full parameter control
- Scriptable and automatable
- Works in GitHub Actions and Azure DevOps

---

### ⚡ Smart Test Mode

**Use when:** Testing changes, iterating, validating before production

**What happens:**
1. ✅ Gets copilot and all components from source environment
2. ✅ Deploys directly to target (no solution packaging)
3. ✅ Updates in place if already exists, creates new if not
4. ✅ Publishes immediately
5. ✅ Opens test chat in browser

**Time:** 30-60 seconds

```powershell
# Interactive — prompts for copilot and environment
.\Navigator.ps1 -Mode SmartTest

# With parameters
.\Navigator.ps1 -Mode SmartTest -BotName "Sales Assistant" -Source "Development" -Target "UAT" -OpenTestChat
```

> 💡 Bots deployed via Smart Test land in the Default Solution. To clean up, just delete the bot from the target environment.

---

### 📦 DV Solution Migration

**Use when:** Deploying to production, need audit trail, formal ALM process

**What happens:**
1. ✅ Exports copilot from source
2. ✅ Prompts for migration type (Full Copilot or Template Only)
3. ✅ Prompts for parameter customisation (name, description, language, schema name)
4. ✅ Creates solution: `Navigator_SalesAssistant_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`
5. ✅ Packages all components with dependencies
6. ✅ Imports as managed solution
7. ✅ Publishes with full audit trail

**Time:** 4-8 minutes

```powershell
# Interactive
.\Navigator.ps1 -Mode DV

# To Production
.\Navigator.ps1 -Mode DV -BotName "Sales Assistant" -Target "Production"
```

> 🔒 **Production Safety:** Targeting "Production" automatically switches to DV Solution Migration, even if Smart Test was specified.

---

#### Migration Types (DV mode only)

| Type | What Migrates | Use Case |
|------|--------------|----------|
| **Full Copilot** | Everything — topics, knowledge, skills, triggers | Standard migration |
| **Template Only** | Bot structure only, no content | Create a blank template from an existing bot |

---

#### Parameter Customisation (DV mode only)

During DV migration you are prompted to optionally override:

| Parameter | Example | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| **Bot Name** | `Sales Assistant v2` | Rename at import time |
| **Description** | `Production release` | Override the bot description |
| **Language** | `1033` | Locale code — 1033 = English (US) |
| **Schema Name** | `new_SalesAssistant` | Dataverse unique name |

Press Enter to keep the original value for any field.

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Smart Test Mode Issues

#### "Component failed to update"
**Cause:** Component has dependencies not in target environment

**Solution:**
```powershell
# Check for missing connections, flows, or custom connectors
# Either:
1. Import dependencies first, or
2. Use DV Solution Migration mode (handles dependencies)
```

#### "Copilot already exists"
**This is normal!** Smart Test mode updates existing copilots.

If you want a fresh copy:
```powershell
# Delete existing copilot in target first
# Then run Quick deploy
```

---

### DV Solution Migration Mode Issues

#### "Solution import failed"
**Common causes:**
- Missing dependencies
- Environment version mismatch
- Permission issues

**Solution:**
```powershell
# 1. Check dependencies
# 2. Verify target environment version
# 3. Confirm admin permissions
```

---

### Authentication Issues

#### "Failed to get access token"
```powershell
# Re-login to Azure CLI
az login

# Verify correct subscription
az account show
```

---

### General Issues

#### "Prerequisites not met"
```powershell
# Check PowerShell version
$PSVersionTable.PSVersion  # Must be 7.0+

# Check Azure CLI
az version  # Must be installed

# Re-run prerequisite check
.\install-skill.ps1 -WhatIf
```
