## [2.0.0] - 2026-03-28

### Added
- 🚀 **MAJOR: Dual-Mode Deployment System**
  - **Quick Mode** (default) - Fast testing deployment (30-60 seconds, no solutions)
  - **Full Mode** - Production deployment with solution packaging (4-8 minutes)
  - Smart mode detection based on target environment (Production always uses Full mode)
  - New enhanced script: `Invoke-Navigator-Enhanced.ps1`

- ⚡ **Quick Deploy Module** (`Modules\Copilot-QuickDeploy.psm1`)
  - Direct copilot deployment without solution creation
  - Updates existing copilots in place
  - Perfect for rapid testing and iteration
  - No solution artifacts to manage
  - Automatic cleanup (just delete the bot when done)

- 🧩 **Core Shared Module** (`Modules\Copilot-Core.psm1`)
  - Shared utilities used by both Quick and Full modes
  - Authentication, environment management, copilot operations
  - Common helper functions
  - Consistent behavior across modes

- 📚 **Comprehensive Documentation Suite** (in `docs/` folder)
  - `ARCHITECTURE-DECISION.md` - Why dual-mode integration was chosen
  - `BOTS-WITHOUT-SOLUTIONS.md` - Technical explanation of bots without solutions
  - `THREE-CHANNEL-ARCHITECTURE.md` - How the three channels work (Claude Skill, PowerShell, VS Code)
  - `IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md` - Step-by-step implementation details

- 🎯 **Enhanced Skill Definition** (`skills/navigator-enhanced.md`)
  - Updated for dual-mode support
  - Clear instructions for Quick vs Full mode
  - Example conversations and workflows
  - Mode selection logic

### Changed
- **Default behavior:** Quick mode is now default for all non-production deployments
- **Production safety:** Production target automatically switches to Full mode regardless of user request
- **Three-channel support:** Same functionality accessible via Claude Skill, PowerShell, and VS Code (future)
- Enhanced command parsing: Supports "quick", "test", "deploy", "full", "migrate", "production" keywords
- Improved user experience with clear mode indicators and timing estimates

### Architecture
- **Quick Mode:**
  - Deploys copilot directly to target environment
  - No solution packaging overhead
  - Updates existing copilots in place (overwrites)
  - Fast: 30-60 seconds average
  - Use case: Testing, iteration, development

- **Full Mode:**
  - Creates solution with auto-generated name
  - Packages all components with dependencies
  - Managed solution support
  - Slower: 4-8 minutes average
  - Use case: Production, formal ALM, audit trail

### Technical Details
- Bots can exist without custom solutions (in Default Solution)
- Solutions are optional packaging for ALM, not runtime requirements
- Quick deploy creates/updates bots as unmanaged entities
- Full deploy creates managed solutions for production governance

### Breaking Changes
- None - Existing `Invoke-Navigator.ps1` continues to work for Full mode
- New `Invoke-Navigator-Enhanced.ps1` provides dual-mode access
- Fully backward compatible with v1.x workflows

### Migration from v1.x
- v1.x users: Continue using `Invoke-Navigator.ps1` (unchanged)
- v2.0 users: Use `Invoke-Navigator-Enhanced.ps1` for Quick and Full modes
- Both scripts can coexist

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-28

### Added
- 🔍 **NEW: Copilot Analysis Feature** - Comprehensive copilot analysis without external APIs
  - Analyze copilot structure, topics, skills, and knowledge sources
  - Complexity scoring system (0-10 scale with breakdown)
  - Quality assessment with good practices and improvement suggestions
  - Migration readiness estimation
  - Automated summary generation
  - Export analysis as Markdown or JSON
  - New analysis module (`Modules\Copilot-Analysis.psm1`)
- 🧭 **NEW: Automatic Solution Management** - Clean solution creation for each import
  - Auto-creates new solution for each copilot import
  - Naming pattern: `Navigator_BotName_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`
  - Prevents copilots from going to Default Solution
  - Includes bot and all components in the new solution
  - Better ALM (Application Lifecycle Management) support
- 🎯 Main menu system to choose between Migration and Analysis
- 📊 Interactive analysis workflow with detailed reports
- ✅ Quality metrics: Good practices detection, improvement suggestions, issue identification
- 📈 Complexity metrics: Topics, custom logic, integrations, knowledge, size
- ⏱️ Migration time estimation based on complexity
- 💾 Multiple export formats for analysis reports (MD, JSON, Text)

### Changed
- Renamed from "Copilot Migration Commander" to "Copilot Migration Pathfinder"
- Updated banner and branding from military theme (🎖️) to navigation theme (🧭)
- Updated quotes from "In the desert, the tank is king" to "Every journey begins with a single step"
- Refactored main execution to show operation selection menu
- Main workflow now returns to menu after completion instead of exiting

### Fixed
- 🐛 **CRITICAL: Import Error 0x80060888** - Fixed "CRM do not support direct update of Entity Reference properties"
  - Removed `parentbotid` field before setting `@odata.bind` navigation property
  - Now properly removes all system fields and entity references before import
  - Prevents Dataverse API error when importing bot components
- 🐛 **Missing Components Import** - Fixed only Topics being imported
  - Now imports ALL component types: Topics, Triggers, AND Skills
  - Previously Triggers and Skills were counted but not actually imported
  - Components now correctly linked to parent bot using navigation properties

### Documentation
- 📚 Enhanced README to 56KB with comprehensive documentation
- 📂 Added Project Structure section explaining all scripts and modules
- ⚡ Documented test-setup.ps1 quick prerequisites checker
