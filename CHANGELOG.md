## [2.2.0] - 2026-03-28

### Changed
- Renamed `Invoke-Navigator-Enhanced.ps1` → `Navigator.ps1` (shorter, cleaner)
- Mode `Quick` renamed to `SmartTest` — deploys to any environment, not just UAT
- Mode `Full` renamed to `DV` — displays as "DV Solution Migration"
- Updated all labels, parameters, command IDs, and descriptions across all files
- VS Code commands: "Navigator: Quick Deploy" → "Navigator: Smart Test", "Navigator: Full Migration" → "Navigator: DV Solution Migration"
- VS Code command IDs: `navigator.quickDeploy` → `navigator.smartTest`, `navigator.fullMigration` → `navigator.dvMigration`

---

## [2.1.0] - 2026-03-28

### Added
- 🖥️ **Channel 3: VS Code Extension** (`vscode-extension/`)
  - `Ctrl+Shift+T` keyboard shortcut for Quick Deploy
  - Command Palette: "Navigator: Quick Deploy" and "Navigator: Full Migration"
  - Bot name input box + target environment picker (QuickPick dropdown)
  - Progress notification showing [1/3], [2/3], [3/3] milestones
  - "Open Test Chat" button on Quick Deploy success
  - Dedicated Navigator output channel for full script output
  - Error notification with "Show Output" button on failure
  - Calls existing `Invoke-Navigator-Enhanced.ps1` — zero duplicated logic

- 📁 **Project structure improvements**
  - `planning/` folder for session notes and planning docs (gitignored)
  - `temp/` folder for exported bot JSON artifacts (gitignored)

### Fixed
- 🐛 `az powerplatform` extension dependency removed — environments now fetched via REST API directly (`https://api.bap.microsoft.com`)
- 🐛 `Select-Copilot` not recognized — removed nested `Import-Module` from `Copilot-QuickDeploy.psm1` that was pulling `Copilot-Core` out of session scope
- 🐛 Environment names blank — fixed `PSCustomObject` vs hashtable indexing issue; added `@()` array forcing; added `displayName → friendlyName → name` fallback chain
- 🐛 401 Unauthorized on Dataverse calls — `Get-AuthHeaders` now accepts `-Resource` parameter; all Dataverse callers pass `$envUrl` as resource for correctly scoped tokens
- 🐛 `$filter` unsupported on `bots` entity — switched to client-side filtering (`Where-Object`) for bot name lookups
- 🐛 Empty `BotId` on create — added `Prefer: return=representation` header to POST so Dataverse returns the created entity
- 🐛 `_publishedby_value cannot be updated to null` — `Remove-SystemFields` now strips all `_*_value` reference fields automatically
- 🐛 Components not migrated — replaced hardcoded type filters (0/1/2) with `All` collection capturing every `componenttype`; resolves missing Knowledge (type 16), Topics (type 9), Agent skills (type 15)

### Changed
- Modules moved from `scripts/Modules/` to flat `scripts/` — matches Claude Code skill spec
- `SKILL.md` now has required frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `triggers`)
- Source environment selection is now interactive (no longer hardcoded to "Development")
- `docs/` folder gitignored (internal planning docs)
- README cleaned of v1/v2 migration references and internal docs links

### Removed
- `Copilot-LLM-Intelligence.psm1` — not imported by any script
- Duplicate root-level scripts (`Invoke-Navigator-Enhanced.ps1`, `Invoke-Navigator.ps1`, `Modules/`)
- `README-v1.1.0-backup.md`
- All `docs/` internal planning documents

## [2.0.0] - 2026-03-28

### Added
- 🚀 **MAJOR: Dual-Mode Deployment System**
  - **Quick Mode** (default) - Fast testing deployment (30-60 seconds, no solutions)
  - **Full Mode** - Production deployment with solution packaging (4-8 minutes)
  - Smart mode detection based on target environment (Production always uses Full mode)
  - New enhanced script: `Invoke-Navigator-Enhanced.ps1`

- ⚡ **Quick Deploy Module** (`Modules\Copilot-QuickDeploy.psm1`)
  - Direct copilot deployment without solution creation
  - Updates existing copilots in place
  - Perfect for rapid testing and iteration
  - No solution artifacts to manage
  - Automatic cleanup (just delete the bot when done)

- 🧩 **Core Shared Module** (`Modules\Copilot-Core.psm1`)
  - Shared utilities used by both Quick and Full modes
  - Authentication, environment management, copilot operations
  - Common helper functions
  - Consistent behavior across modes

- 📚 **Comprehensive Documentation Suite** (in `docs/` folder)
  - `ARCHITECTURE-DECISION.md` - Why dual-mode integration was chosen
  - `BOTS-WITHOUT-SOLUTIONS.md` - Technical explanation of bots without solutions
  - `THREE-CHANNEL-ARCHITECTURE.md` - How the three channels work (Claude Skill, PowerShell, VS Code)
  - `IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md` - Step-by-step implementation details

- 🎯 **Enhanced Skill Definition** (`skills/navigator-enhanced.md`)
  - Updated for dual-mode support
  - Clear instructions for Quick vs Full mode
  - Example conversations and workflows
  - Mode selection logic

### Changed
- **Default behavior:** Quick mode is now default for all non-production deployments
- **Production safety:** Production target automatically switches to Full mode regardless of user request
- **Three-channel support:** Same functionality accessible via Claude Skill, PowerShell, and VS Code (future)
- Enhanced command parsing: Supports "quick", "test", "deploy", "full", "migrate", "production" keywords
- Improved user experience with clear mode indicators and timing estimates

### Architecture
- **Quick Mode:**
  - Deploys copilot directly to target environment
  - No solution packaging overhead
  - Updates existing copilots in place (overwrites)
  - Fast: 30-60 seconds average
  - Use case: Testing, iteration, development

- **Full Mode:**
  - Creates solution with auto-generated name
  - Packages all components with dependencies
  - Managed solution support
  - Slower: 4-8 minutes average
  - Use case: Production, formal ALM, audit trail

### Technical Details
- Bots can exist without custom solutions (in Default Solution)
- Solutions are optional packaging for ALM, not runtime requirements
- Quick deploy creates/updates bots as unmanaged entities
- Full deploy creates managed solutions for production governance

### Breaking Changes
- None - Existing `Invoke-Navigator.ps1` continues to work for Full mode
- New `Invoke-Navigator-Enhanced.ps1` provides dual-mode access
- Fully backward compatible with v1.x workflows

### Migration from v1.x
- v1.x users: Continue using `Invoke-Navigator.ps1` (unchanged)
- v2.0 users: Use `Invoke-Navigator-Enhanced.ps1` for Quick and Full modes
- Both scripts can coexist

  - Now properly removes all system fields and entity references before import
